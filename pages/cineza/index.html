                        <p class="p-wrap">
                            In the past, when people wanted to book a movie ticket, they had to go to the cinema, and
                            there was no way to know showtimes, available seats, ticket prices for different types of
                            seats, or the start time of a specific show unless they went to the theater in person. There
                            were many instances where people arrived at the theater only to find out that the show was
                            sold out. Additionally, customers faced difficulties in finding movies through traditional
                            methods. Moreover, managing these tasks was also challenging, as all receipts and show
                            schedules had to be manually stored on paper, making it easy for mistakes and losses to
                            occur, causing difficulties in management and reporting. Applying technology to movie ticket
                            booking management helps administrators reduce a large amount of work. At the same time,
                            customers can easily search for and book the movie they love, and they can also stay
                            informed about showtimes, schedules, and make payments quickly.
